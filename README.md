A collection of coding pojects I have done.

These are primarily examples from class projects, taken from various classes I have completed. 

I attempted to keep only files that are original, but a couple include code that was provided in course material. I have annotated where this is the case. 
In attempting to keep it to only my own code several of these projects won't function completely, becasue they depend on other files/code that I did not write. 
I hope the code in these files demonstrates my skill in a digestable way. 
If you need a fully functioning version, please contact me and I will provide you with the necessary code. 

The Database example contains code for creating a MySQL relational database (SQL, DDL, DML, PL/SQL, etc..) as well as code for a web based interface (Node.js, HTML, CSS).
